  -------------------------------------
    Provider for ESPN Scoreboard Data
  -------------------------------------

  Provides scores for
    NCAAF (College Football, FBS Division)
    NBA (National Basketball Association)

  Data API also provides scoreboard data for MANY other
  leagues, not currently supported.  NCAAM (Men's
  College Basketball) support to come in the near future.

  You can get an idea of what sports and leagues are
  supported here:
  http://www.espn.com/static/apis/devcenter/io-docs.html

  Documentation for the feed can be found here:
  http://www.espn.com/static/apis/devcenter/docs/scores.html#parameters

  ESPN has several different APIs for various sports data,
  most of which need an API key.  ESPN no longer gives out
  public API keys.  The good news is the Scoreboard API does
  not require an API key. It's free and clear.  Let's not
  abuse this.  Please do not modify this to hammer the API
  with a flood of calls, otherwise it might cause ESPN to
  lock this it down.

  Data is polled on demand per league configured in the
  front end. Each time the front end makes a request for a
  particular league a request for JSON is made to ESPN's
  servers.  The front end polls every two miuntes.

        as the FBS teams.  Wouldn't you know it but there is a SDSU in both divisions --
        totally different schools!!!
        So we'll deal with it here.  There is an SDSU logo file with a space at the end of
        its name (e.g.: "SDSU .png" that is for the FCS team.  We'll use that abbreviation
        which will load a different logo file, but the extra space will collapse in HTML
        when the short code is displayed).

        The big irony here is that the SAME school as the FCS SDSU has a different ESPN short
        code for basketball: SDST.
